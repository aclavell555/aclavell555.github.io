    <h1>Taking a Moment to Be</h1>
    <h2>Turning off the "go-go-go" mode</h2>
    

    <p>"When was the last time you sat down?," my bemused sister asked as she watched me zip from one task to the next. I had a long list of things to get done before the day's end and, to my way of thinking back then, constantly doing something was akin to being a useful member of society. <p/>

    <p>Of course, I had not analyzed my need to do in those days. I lived my life believing that I had goals to complete and, whenever I came up short, a deep sense of self-disappointment would come over me.<p/>

    <p>I finally did have to sit down some years later when ill health forced me into a standstill. This pause to my non-stop routine gave me a new perspective about priorities and, once I had recovered, helped guide me into a new mindset, one where <em>just being </em>was not the same as being lazy. 

    <p>Knowing this has finally allowed me to choose when to take up challenges and when to be still and at peace. It has shown me what absolute happiness is versus our culture's relative happiness, the one we measure by our success and failure.</p>

    <p>I invite you to take a break from your go-go-go day and <em><strong>just be.</em></strong><p/>
